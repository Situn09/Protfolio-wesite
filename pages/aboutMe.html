        Passionate about Psychology, Technology, and Finance | Aspiring Stock Market Trader and Software Developer
<br><br>
About Me:
<br>
Greetings! I'm a dynamic individual with a diverse range of interests and an unyielding drive to learn and grow. My academic journey led me to a master's degree in physics from the esteemed IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. However, it was during the recent lockdown (2020-2021) that I embarked on a transformative career exploration, shifting my focus from physics to various exciting paths, including digital marketing, stock market trading, software development, affiliate marketing, and dropshipping.
<br>
During this exploratory phase, I delved into different fields during my free time. Among the various pursuits, stock market trading and software development captured my heart. I made earnest efforts to learn both simultaneously, although I gravitated more intensively towards stock market trading.
<br>
In my pursuit of knowledge in stock market trading, I faced challenges and encountered setbacks, resulting in the loss of my savings. Nevertheless, these experiences became invaluable lessons. I realized that experience alone couldn't suffice without the capital required to thrive in the stock market. This realization prompted me to seek opportunities in my other great passion: software development.
<br>
In my quest to become a proficient software developer, I immersed myself in a broad spectrum of technologies, including web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), AI (Python), SAP SD, and backend development (Java). After several months of exploration, I recognized the need to focus on a specific domain to excel.
Presently, I'm directing my efforts towards mastering backend development using Java. My journey is an ongoing one, and my next goal is to become a web development expert after conquering this challenge.
